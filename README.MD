InvestorsToolKit.Gadget

This project began as a Gadget for Microsoft Windows back when gadgets were a thing. The goal was to create a calculator that allowed an investor to store a few trading parameters to assist with making buy decisions. For example, trade commissions, expected margins, and other fees can be set. Then using the calculator, one would enter the price of the security in question, click calculate, and the calculator would return a minimum selling cost based on the aforementioned factors.

If the momentum/trading volume of the security appear to support the suggested selling price, a decision could be made to take a position in the stock.

Although some of the original artifacts are still present in the project, the code no longer loads and runs as a gadget. It will however function as a HTML webpage.
